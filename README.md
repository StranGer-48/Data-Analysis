# Data-Analysis

**Data analysis** is a process of inspecting, cleasing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different bussiness world, data analysis plays a role making decisions more scentific.

*Analysis*, refers to dividing a whole into its separate components for individuals examination. *Data analysis*, is a process for obtaining raw data, and subsequently converting it into information useful for decision-making by users. *Data*, is collected and analyzed to answer quesions, test hypothesis, or disprove theories.

There are different steps in data analysis:
  * Data equirements 
  * Data collection
  * Data processing
  * Data cleaning
  * Exploratory data analysis
  * Modeling and algorithms
 
 ## Data requirements
 The data are necessary as inputs to the anylysis, which is specified based upon the requirements of those directing the analysis.
 
 ## Data collection
 The data may also be collected from sensors in the environment, including traffic cameras, satillites, recording devices, etc. It may also be obtained through inteviews, download from online sources, or reading documentation.
 
 ## Data processing
 Data, when initially obtained, must be processsed or organized for analysis. For instance, these may involve placing data into rrows andd columns in a table format for further analysis.
 
 ## Data cleaning
 Once processed and organized, the data may be incomplete, contain duplicates, or contain errors. The need for data cleaning, will arise from problems in the way that the datum are entered ans sorted. Data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors. Common tasks include record matching, identifying inaccuracy of data, pverall quality of existing data, deduplication, and column segmentation. Such data problems can also be identified through a variety of analytical techniques. There are several types of data cleaning, that are depending upon the type of data in the set; this could be phone numbers, emails addresses, employers, or other values. Quantitaive data methods for outlier detection, can be used to get rid of data that appears to have higher likelihood of being input incorrectly.
 
 ## Exploratory data analysis
 Once the datasets are cleaned, it can then be analyzed. Analyst may apply may apply a variety of techniques, referred to as exploratory data analysis, to begin understanding the messages contained within the obtained data. The process of data exploration may result in additional data cleaning or additional requests for data. Descriptive statistics, such as, the average or median, can be generated to aid in understanding the data. Data visualization is also a technique used, in which the analyst is able to examine the data in a graphical format in order to obtain additional insights, regarding the messages within the data.
 
 ## Modeling and algorithms
 Mathematical formulas or models, may be applied to the data in order to identify  relationships among the variables; for example, using correlation or causation. In general terms, models may be developed to evaluate a specific variable based on other variables contained within the dataset, with some residual error depending on the implemented model's accuracy.

In this course I am gonna discuss about how these steps are implemented using Python Programming language. There are different Python libraries for data analysis:

 > **Numpy**
   NumPys stands for Numerical Python. The most powerful feature of NumPy is n-dimentional array. This library also contains basic linear algebra functions, Fourier transforms, advanced random number capabililties and tools for integration with other low level languagues like C and C++. Numpy colab tutorial is [here](https://github.com/StranGer-48/Data-Analysis/blob/main/NumPyTutorial_1.ipynb)
   
>**SciPy - Fundamental Scientific Computing**
  Scipy stands for Scientific Python. It is built on NumPy. Scipy is one of the most useful library for variety of high level science and engineering modules like discrete Fourier transform, Linear Algebra, Optimization and Sparse martices.
   
   
 > **Pandas - Data Manipulation and Analysis**
   Pandas for structured data operations and manipulations. It is extensively used for data munging and preparation. Pandas were added relatively recently to Python and have been instrumental in boosting Python's usage in data scientist community.
   Pandas colab tutorial is [here](https://github.com/StranGer-48/Data-Analysis/blob/main/PandasTurorial.ipynb)
  
 > **Matplotlib - Plotting and Visualization**
   Matplotlib for plotting vast variety of graphs, starting from histograms to line plots to heat plots. You can use Pylab feature in ipython norebook to use these plotting feature inline. If you ignore the inline option, then pylab converts ipython environment to an environment, very similar to Matlab.

 > **Scikit-learn - Machine Learning and Data Mining**
   Scikit Learn for machine learning. Built on Numpy, Scipy AND matplotlib, this library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensional reduction.
 
 > **StatsModels - Statistical Modeling, Testing and Analysis**
   Statsmodels for statistical modeling. It is a Python module that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests. An extensive list of descriptive statistics, stastical tests, plotting functions, and result statistics are available for different types of data and each estimator.
   
 > **Seaborn - For Statistical Data Visualization**
   Seaborn for statistical data visualization. It is a library for making attractive and informative statistical graphics in Python. It is based on matplotlib. Seaborn aims to male visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data.
